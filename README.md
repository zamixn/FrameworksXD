## About

This is a collection of some simple frameworks for Unity developed to be used for game jams, in order to save time by not needing to implement simple mechanics that are present in a lot of games.

## Frameworks

# [DelayedEventsXD](https://github.com/zamixn/FrameworksXD/tree/master/Assets/FrameworksXD/DelayedEventsXD)

A really simple implementation of delayed action invoking using Unity couroutines. Bad performance, don't use :)

# [ParticleXD](https://github.com/zamixn/FrameworksXD/tree/master/Assets/FrameworksXD/ParticleXD)

* A particle manager system. 
* Uses a serialized object to store a dictionary of particle effect data.
* Custom editor to add/delete/modify particle effect data.
* Play particle effects from anywhere using a Singleton: ParticleManager.Instance.Play

# [PoolXD](https://github.com/zamixn/FrameworksXD/tree/master/Assets/FrameworksXD/PoolXD)

* An implementation of generic object pooling.
* An implementation of Unity gameobject pooling, which inherits from the generic object pooling 

# [RuntimeEnumEditor](https://github.com/zamixn/FrameworksXD/tree/master/Assets/FrameworksXD/RuntimeEnumEditorXD)
